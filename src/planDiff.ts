/**
 * The plan diff — `diff(model, planned)` — ported from `scryer-core/src/diff.rs`.
 *
 * Scryer holds two persisted layers: `model` (the committed source of truth,
 * `model.scry`) and `planned` (the draft the canvas and agent edit). The diff
 * between them IS the plan: per element, how `planned` (`to`) diverges from the
 * committed `model` (`from`) — Added / Deleted / Moved / Repointed / Reworded /
 * MembersChanged. This replaces the old per-element `status` lifecycle: a claim
 * the code doesn't back yet is simply `Added` in the plan; a reworded one is
 * `Reworded`; the live diff needs no stored baseline (no `changedFrom`).
 *
 * Computed client-side so the diff updates live as you edit, with no async
 * round-trip. The JSON shape mirrors the Rust `ModelDiff` exactly (the agent
 * consumes the same diff via `get_pending`), so the two never disagree.
 * Identity is carried by stable ids, so a reparent reads as `Moved` and a
 * relabel as `Reworded`, never as a spurious delete-plus-add.
