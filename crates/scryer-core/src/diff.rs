//! Model diff — the PLANNING substrate.
//!
//! Scryer holds three layers: `planned` (the intent the canvas and agent edit),
//! `model` (the committed source of truth, `model.scry`), and `code` (the
//! implementation). The two diffs between them drive everything:
//!
//!   1. **plan diff** = `model` ↔ `planned` — what we intend to change. Rendered
//!      git-status style; the agent's work queue ("make code satisfy the plan").
//!      An element commits (planned folds into model) once the code backs it.
//!   2. **drift diff** = `model` ↔ `code` — where committed spec and reality
//!      disagree (the reconcile-from-codebase surface).
//!
//! [`diff`] is the one engine behind both: given a `from` model (the base) and a
//! `to` model (the target), it reports per element how `to` diverges from `from`
//! — `Added` / `Deleted` / `Moved` / `Repointed` / `Reworded`. For the plan
//! diff, call `diff(model, planned)`: `Added` then means "in the plan, not yet
//! committed", `Deleted` means "marked for removal".
//!
//! Identity is carried by stable ids (nodes, links, responsibilities), so a
//! reparent reads as `Moved` and a relabel as `Reworded` — never as a spurious
//! delete-plus-add.
//!
//! Coverage: nodes, links, responsibilities, properties, and groups.
//! Properties have no id, so they are keyed by `(owner node, label)` — a label
//! change reads as delete-plus-add, which is acceptable for plain data fields.
