//! The change ledger — named partitions of the plan.
//!
//! The plan is one draft file; without this module it is a single anonymous
//! transaction ("git's working tree without branches"). A **change** gives a
//! slice of that draft a name and a rationale — the dev's original sentence,
//! the one artifact that otherwise dies in the chat log — so that pending work
//! can be listed, reviewed, folded, and resumed *per task* instead of as one
//! pile.
//!
//! The representation is a side-map, not a field on every element (mirroring
//! `source_map`/`boundaries`): [`ScryModel::change_map`] maps an element key
//! (see [`element_key`]) to a change id, and [`ScryModel::changes`] is the
//! registry of open changes. Both live ONLY in the plan layer — the committed
//! model never carries change state ([`crate::write_model_at`] strips it), and
//! a change's durable record after it closes is a [`crate::history`] event.
//! A side-map also covers what a per-element field cannot: a planned
//! *deletion* has no element left to tag, but its key can still map to the
//! change that ordered it.
//!
//! Lifecycle: a change opens with a rationale ([`open_change`]), writes tag
//! the elements they author ([`tag`]), and the plan↔committed diff remains the
//! single source of what is pending — the map holds no state of its own beyond
//! the grouping. That is enforced by the GC invariant: **every map key must
//! correspond to a current diff entry** ([`gc`] prunes the rest). A change
//! closes when a prune takes its last key — folding an element removes it from
//! the diff (implemented), and so does reverting it (abandoned); either way
//! the change's record is appended to history ([`record_closed`]) and the
//! registry entry is dropped. "If it's committed, it's done" — there is no
//! separate close verb.
//!
//! An open change with NO tagged elements yet is legitimate (just opened, or
//! all its work still unwritten) and is never GC'd: [`gc`] closes only
//! changes whose keys the prune itself removed.
