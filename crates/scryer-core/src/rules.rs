        body: r#"A `symbol` is exactly one addressable code definition — a function, method, handler, hook, React component, class, struct, interface, type, or config object. One symbol node = one definition in the source; its name must be the identifier as it appears in the code. A definition earns a symbol node only when it carries architecture — a behavioral responsibility at its OWN altitude, or a declared data shape. A cross-boundary link alone does NOT justify a symbol: a link is a relationship between nodes that already exist for their own reasons, never a reason to mint one. So an otherwise-empty symbol (no responsibility, no data shape) is never kept just because something links to it — fold it away. Being a real, public definition is NOT sufficient either: a wrapper, re-export, getter/setter, or test stub that discharges NO distinct responsibility folds into its component's responsibilities rather than minting a leaf. An executable entry point is one of these: `main` (or any top-level binary entry that only wires up and dispatches the program's work) carries the binary's behavior at the COMPONENT's altitude, not a sub-altitude — fold its responsibility into the component that represents that binary (the example, CLI, or bootstrap IS that single unit of architecture) rather than minting a `main` leaf; helper definitions in the same binary that hold their own distinct responsibility still earn their nodes. But the fold test is about ARCHITECTURE, not implementation size: thinness of the body is NEVER by itself grounds to fold — a three-line function that crosses a boundary (an IPC command, an API endpoint, a contract surface) or holds any distinct own-altitude accountability earns its node however few lines it is. And the two operations are NOT symmetric: declining to MINT a node for an empty definition at extraction time is cheap and reversible; DELETING an existing symbol that carries — or, mapping to real code, SHOULD carry — a distinct responsibility destroys authored architecture and its source anchor, so it demands a far higher bar. A symbol that maps to real own-altitude behavior is DEFINED — give it the responsibility — never deleted; an empty model slot for such a symbol means not-yet-authored, not absent, so "define or delete" resolves to DEFINE. A parent responsibility that enumerates the symbol ("reads, writes, and deletes …") is NOT evidence the symbol is covered: that is the parent mis-scoped (see [[altitude]]), never a license to prune the child. Fold generated mirror types (`*-types`, `*.d.ts`) into the source-of-truth symbol and leave private helper methods out. Prefer a component with a handful of meaningful symbols over one mirroring every definition in its files. A symbol has two independent facets; most carry one, some carry both:
- **responsibilities** — the behavior the definition discharges. Map each to the specific LINE RANGE that does its work (with the enclosing `symbol` named as anchor and context). A line range must be a PROPER subset of the symbol; when one responsibility is the whole definition's work, omit `line`/`endLine` entirely — a symbol-only anchor means "this whole definition". `update_source_map` enforces this: a range covering the whole symbol is stripped to the symbol anchor and reported. Two responsibilities sharing an enclosing symbol must point at different line ranges; if they point at the identical range they are one responsibility.
- **properties** — when the definition DECLARES A DATA SHAPE (a struct/class/interface/type, or a config object that defines a field schema), list its fields here: one property per field. Map the declaration to the symbol's node id via the `schemas` source array (not `entries`).
NEVER describe a data shape in a responsibility statement. "Defines the lead record schema with status, qualification, and booking fields" is WRONG — that prose belongs nowhere; enumerate `status`, `qualification`, `booking`, … as actual `properties`. A config object that both wires behavior and declares fields (e.g. an ORM/CMS collection that registers admin UI and lifecycle hooks AND defines the record's fields) gets BOTH facets: behavioral responsibilities for the hooks/UI, and a property per declared field — and those properties are the declared FIELDS (the record's columns), never the config wrapper keys (slug/admin/hooks/access). A pure data type carries only properties. Symbols carry no boundary glob (that is a container/component concept). **Scoping**: determine parentage from the import/usage graph, not from file co-location. A code-level node belongs to whichever component actually consumes it. If multiple components import the same code, parent it to the one that owns/defines it and add links from the others — the cross-boundary dependency is valuable signal."#,

A link is legal only when src and dst are siblings (same parent), OR the deeper node's parent already links to the other node — which makes that node a *reference* on the deeper node's surface. References thus propagate DOWN from higher-level links: at system context a person/external links to the SYSTEM; to also wire it to a specific container or component, the relationship must exist at every level in between. So when an external is used deep inside your system, add the link at EACH level: system→external, then container→external, then component→external — each one authorizes the next. Two consequences: (a) you cannot link a deep node straight to a top-level external without the intervening links — add them parent-first (a single `add_links` batch may include all the levels at once); (b) every node down to component level still needs a relationship at its OWN level, or it appears disconnected on its own diagram — symbols are exempt: they justify themselves through their claims (see [[symbols]]), and the code-level graph is legitimately sparse. You may model a relationship only as deep as it is useful — a `container → external` link need not be refined to the component that calls it; the external simply won't appear inside the container view until a component links to it, and that is fine. Never link a node to its own ancestor/descendant — nesting already expresses containment. Run `validate_model` and fix every warning before finishing."#,

That discipline makes anchoring the completeness signal: a node's completeness is its ANCHORED primitives over its AUTHORED ones (committed + planned), rolled up over the subtree. The countable primitives are each node's own anchor (a container/component's boundary glob — "the box"; a symbol's definition), each LEAF responsibility, and each data-shape property set. A structural node's OWN responsibilities are NOT counted — they discharge through the subtree (see [[altitude]]). So a container you have scaffolded — boundary glob set over the real directory, but its responsibilities and children not yet anchored — reads as a LOW, non-zero completeness: instantly legible as "scaffolded, not built out". As you implement and anchor each leaf, the number climbs; a node with no anchorable leaf primitives beneath it yet is unmeasured (—), not complete. On a greenfield model nothing is anchored and the denominator is the authored plan, so everything reads 0% — correct: fully specced, nothing built.

- Unwanted behaviour (failure/rejection handling): "If <condition>, then <response>."
- Optional feature: "Where <feature is present>, <response>" — legal EARS, rarely earned here; prefer modeling the feature as structure.
Clauses stack in that order when a claim genuinely needs both: "While <state>, when <trigger>, <response>". The ubiquitous form is EARNED, never the default: before leaving a claim plain, check whether it actually holds only on a trigger, state, or failure — if so, it MUST take the keyword form; a condition written as a tail ("…after acking the webhook") moves to the front in its keyword form. One pattern per claim: a statement that bundles a happy path with its rejection ("echo the challenge when the token matches, else reject with 403") is TWO claims — the When and the If — split it (see [[altitude]], [[scanning]]). Compound responses split the same way: two verbs acting on two different objects ("persist the results and sync labels to HubSpot") is TWO claims — bolding both verbs is NOT a substitute for splitting; only a genuinely atomic verb pair on one object stays together. A rationale tail ("…so sales receives only qualified ones") is not part of the response — cut it or move it to the description (see [[scanning]]).
Statements also carry a markdown-lite display markup the UI renders — and strips for comparison, search, and word-diffing, so it is presentation, never meaning. Wrap the scan anchors — the grammar keywords (including "then") and the response verb — in **bold**, and NOTHING else: "**When** a send-failure status callback arrives, **append** a failed-send event".

A line range must be a PROPER subset of its symbol — when one responsibility is the whole definition's work, omit `line`/`endLine` (a symbol-only anchor means the whole definition); ranges that cover the whole symbol are normalized to symbol-only and reported back. `test_entries` ATTACH TESTS to claims — keyed by responsibility id like `entries`, pointing at the test that exercises the claim (`pattern` = test file, `symbol` = the test function or its `it("…")` string; symbol-only means the whole test) — a separate dimension from where a claim is implemented, and the tool to attach a test AFTER a fold (the fix for an `untested` callout). `schemas` set the declaration location of a schema-kind node (properties, not responsibilities) keyed by node id: `pattern` = file, `symbol` = the type name. `boundaries` set directory globs keyed by node id — the coverage denominator (the code region a node owns); use for containers/components, keeping a child's boundary within its parent's. An empty `locations`/`sources` array clears an entry. Anchoring a PLAN-ADDED claim before it is committed is premature — the build checkpoint is the fold ([[anchor-completeness]])."#,

You do NOT author code-level links: the server wires component→component and symbol→symbol links from the deterministic dependency graph; the optional `links` field is only for cross-boundary relationships (to an external/other-container node id) the graph can't infer, and any link it can't place legally is dropped and reported, never fatal. The server validates the proposal, mints ids, resolves references, derives links, and performs one write; structural problems (missing symbols, duplicate keys) reject the whole proposal with a specific reason — fix exactly that and retry. Filling records structure and anchors only — it attaches no tests, so testable claims land as `untested`: immediately after a fill, attach the tests the codebase ALREADY has via `update_source_map test_entries`; claims with no existing test stay honestly untested until one is written ([[test-attachment]]).

Nothing happens in the developer's working tree: scryer syncs an isolated git worktree (their uncommitted work included) and returns ITS path, so every edit and every test run happens THERE. The call returns the claim's statement, the worktree, the exact file and line span to break, and the attached test files — then make ONE deliberate breaking edit inside that span, run ONLY those test files, and expect RED. Green means the break survived: the test does not hold the claim, and that is the finding. Aim each break at what the claim actually SAYS (a When/If claim names a trigger and a response — attack those), not at whatever is easiest: deleting a function body proves only that something notices. Up to three distinct breaks, stopping early on the first survivor, then `close_probe {probes, survivors}` — always, including when a probe went wrong: it resets the worktree and records the round. No survivors means the claim reads as probed, NOT proven — you sampled, you did not exhaust. Survivors are the real finding: strengthen the test, re-run for a fresh verdict, probe again.
